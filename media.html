            <p>HTML is fundamentally responsive, or fluid. If you create a web page containing only HTML, with no CSS, and resize the window, the browser will automatically reflow the text to fit the viewport.<br>

                While the default responsive behavior may sound like no solution is needed, long lines of text displayed full screen on a wide monitor can be difficult to read. If wide screen line length is reduced with CSS, such as by creating columns or adding significant padding, the site may look squashed for the user who narrows their browser window or opens the site on a mobile device.<br>
                The term responsive design, coined by Ethan Marcotte in 2010, described using fluid grids, fluid images, and media queries to create responsive content, as discussed in Zoe Mickley Gillenwater's book Flexible Web Design.<br>

                At the time, the recommendation was to use CSS float for layout and media queries to query the browser width, creating layouts for different breakpoints. Fluid images are set to not exceed the width of their container; they have their max-width property set to 100%. Fluid images scale down when their containing column narrows but do not grow larger than their intrinsic size when the column grows. This enables an image to scale down to fit its content, rather than overflow it, but not grow larger and become pixelated if the container becomes wider than the image.<br>

                Modern CSS layout methods are inherently responsive, and, since the publication of Gillenwater's book and Marcotte's article, we have a multitude of features built into the web platform to make designing responsive sites easier.<br>

                The rest of this article will point you to the various web platform features you might want to use when creating a responsive site.

            <p>Creating a non-resizable web page by setting a fixed width doesn't work either; that leads to scroll bars on narrow devices and too much empty space on wide screens.<br>

                Responsive web design, or RWD, is a design approach that addresses the range of devices and device sizes, enabling automatic adaption to the screen, whether the content is viewed on a tablet, phone, television, or watch.<br>
                
                Responsive web design isn't a separate technology â€” it is an approach. It is a term used to describe a set of best practices used to create a layout that can respond to any device being used to view the content.
